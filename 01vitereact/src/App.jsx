      <p>
        From this First Lecture Of the React series I have Learned two ways for
        Installing and running React In our Local systems. It is a very
        intresting session and a session filled with lot of knowledge. The way I
        am learning it and exploring React, sply by self doing it is very
        helpful . Thank-You Hitesh Sir and Chai aur Code.
